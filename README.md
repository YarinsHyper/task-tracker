## Overview

The Task Tracker app simulates a real-world productivity application where users can manage tasks, track completion status, and interact with a structured interface.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:

* Component separation
* UI state flow
* Event handling
* Data modeling
* Clean project organization
* Frontend architecture patterns

---

## Features

* Create tasks
* Delete tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Dynamic UI updates
* State-driven rendering
* Responsive layout
* Clean component hierarchy

> This is a demo implementation — backend persistence may be mocked or local only.

---

## Tech Stack

* React
* JavaScript / TypeScript
* Node.js (dev environment)
* CSS / Tailwind (if used)

---

## Getting Started

## Learning Goals

This project demonstrates how a frontend application should be structured in a scalable way:

* Separation between UI and logic
* Predictable state updates
* Reusable component patterns
* Maintainable folder structure
* Readable code organization

It is meant to represent how a real application would be organized — without unnecessary complexity.
